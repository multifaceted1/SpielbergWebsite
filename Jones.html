              <p class="rightFlexedP raiders">The first Indiana Jones film in the series.  Harrison Ford arrived fresh from Star Wars and ready to reinvent himself.  His character is a heroic archeologist who likes to snatch priceless sacred objects from the hands of evildoers. Mr. Ford did most of the stunts himself and learned to use a bullwhip to disarm the bad guys. This movie features Karen Allen as a tough leading lady who can drink a big guy under the table.  This film has lots of battles against Nazis looking for a powerful sacred artifact, the Ark of the Covenant.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP doom">This movie is about a Hindu sect of evil Kali worshipers who Indiana Jones must defeat in order to save the nearby villagers. How has this movie aged? As a Religious Studies major who studied in India, I would like to note that to Hindus, Mother Kali is a savior Goddess who slays demons.  Women in danger in India may call out to her.  When she went too far, she had to be subdued by Shiva. Here is a link: <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Kali/#:~:text=Kali's%20Birth&text=One%20version%20relates%20when%20the,in%20the%20form%20of%20Kali.">Kali: Ancient History Encyclopedia</a> Kali is peacefully worshiped in many temples.  With that being said, this movie is fun, with a cute little kid, bizarre foods, gruesome violence, and lots of excitement. If you can look beyond the cultural insensitivity, and a cartoonish, ever-shrieking leading lady, it's worth watching.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP crusade">In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade we see Indy as a young adolescent, played by River Phoenix. We learn the roots of his devotion to protecting ancient artifacts and his fear of snakes.  Flashing forward we see Indiana Jones as an older professor, now set on a course to find the holy grail. His search takes him to an area near Syria called Hatay. There he teams up with his father, played by Sean Connery, for more Nazi battles.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP skull">Karen Allen from the first movie is back as Marion and the plot returns full circle to it's roots in this excellent finale to the saga.  The object they seek in this film is the Crystal Skull which has mystical powers.  There is some excellent acting by Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett and some cool 1950's scenery as they fight the Russians this time.</p>

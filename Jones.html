              <p class="rightFlexedP">The first Indiana Jones film in the series.  Harrison Ford arrived fresh from Star Wars and ready to reinvent himself.  His character is a heroic archeologist who likes to snatch priceless sacred objects from the hands of evildoers. Mr. Ford did most of the stunts himself and learned to use a bullwhip to disarm the bad guys. This movie features Karen Allen as a tough leading lady who can drink a big guy under the table.  This film has lots of battles against Nazis looking for a powerful sacred artifact, the Ark of the Covenant.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP">This movie is about an hindu sect of evil Kali worshipers who Indiana Jones must defeat in order to save the nearby villagers.  As a religious studies major who studied in India I would like to note that to Hindus, Mother Kali is a savior Goddess who slays demons.  Women in danger in india may call out to her.  When she went to far she had to be subdued by Shiva. Here is a link: <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Kali/#:~:text=Kali's%20Birth&text=One%20version%20relates%20when%20the,in%20the%20form%20of%20Kali.">Kali: Ancient History Encyclopedia</a> Kali is peacefully worshiped in temples without incident.  With that being said, this movie is fun with a cute little kid, bizzare foods, gruesome violence, and lots of terrifying excitement. If you can look beyond a heaping helping of cultural insensitivity, it can be pretty fun to watch at times.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP">In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade we see Indy as a young adolescent and we learn the roots of his devotion to protecting ancient artifacts.  Flashing forward Indy as an older professor, now set on a course to find the holy grail, He teams up with his father, played by Sean Connery, for more Nazi battles.</p>

              <p class="rightFlexedP">Karen Allen from the first movie is back as Marion and the plot returns full circle to it's roots in this excellent finale to the saga.  The object they seek in this film is the Crystal Skull which has mystical powers, of course.  There is some excellent acting by Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett and some fun 1950's scenery as they battle the Russians this time.</p>
